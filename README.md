  Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! Here you will find a collection of practical tasks I have completed using SQL. I have used datasets from Kaggle to demonstrate how SQL can be used to extract valuable information from a variety of sources. Each project is an experiment that has allowed me to develop my SQL query and data analysis skills.

1.	Ecommerce Order

  The E-commerce Order Dataset provides comprehensive information related to orders, items within orders, customers, payments, and products for an e-commerce platform. This dataset is structured with multiple tables, each containing specific information about various aspects of the e-commerce operations.

2.	Remote Work & Mental Health

  This dataset dives into how working remotely affects stress levels, work-life balance, and mental health conditions across various industries and regions.
With 5,000 records collected from employees worldwide, this dataset provides valuable insights into key areas like work location (remote, hybrid, onsite), stress levels, access to mental health resources, and job satisfaction.
