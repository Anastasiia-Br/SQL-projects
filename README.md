  Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! Here you will find a collection of practical tasks I have completed using SQL. I have used datasets from Kaggle to demonstrate how SQL can be used to extract valuable information from a variety of sources. Each project is an experiment that has allowed me to develop my SQL query and data analysis skills.
